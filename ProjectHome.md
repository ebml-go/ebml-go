This is an implementation of an EBML decoder in the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org).

EBML is short for Extensible Binary Meta Language. EBML specifies a binary and octet (byte) aligned format inspired by the principle of XML. EBML itself is a generalized description of the technique of binary markup. Like XML, it is completely agnostic to any data that it might contain.
For a specification, see http://ebml.sourceforge.net/specs/
